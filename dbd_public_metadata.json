            "Supporting Information for research article \"Life cycle comparison of environmental emissions from three disposal options for unused pharmaceutical\". This spreadsheet provides the calculations and values used for this study; please refer to the manuscript and supporting information (as text) available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es203987b for details about how to use this spreadsheet.    We use life cycle assessment methodology to compare three disposal options for unused pharmaceuticals: (i) incineration after take-back to a pharmacy, (ii) wastewater treatment after toilet disposal, and (iii) landfilling or incineration after trash disposal. For each option, emissions of active pharmaceutical ingredients to the environment (API emissions) are estimated along with nine other types of emissions to air and water (non-API emissions). Under a scenario with 50% take-back to a pharmacy and 50% trash disposal, current API emissions are expected to be reduced by 93%. This is within 6% of a 100% trash disposal scenario, which achieves an 88% reduction. The 50% take-back scenario achieves a modest reduction in API emissions over a 100% trash scenario while increasing most non-API emissions by over 300%. If the 50% of unused pharmaceuticals not taken-back are toileted instead of trashed, all emissions increase relative to 100% trash disposal. Evidence suggests that 50% participation in take-back programs could be an upper bound. As a result, we recommend trash disposal for unused pharmaceuticals. A 100% trash disposal program would have similar API emissions to a take-back program with 50% participation, while also having significantly lower non-API emissions, lower financial costs, higher convenience, and higher compliance rates."

            "As discussion and debates on the digital humanities continue among scholars, so too does discussion about how academic libraries can and should support this scholarship. Through interviews with digital humanities scholars and academic librarians within the Center for Institutional Cooperation, this study aims to explore some points of common perspective and underlying tensions in research relationships. Qualitative interviews revealed that, while both groups are enthusiastic about the future of faculty-librarian collaboration on digital scholarship, there remain certain tensions about the role of the library and the librarian. Scholars appreciate the specialized expertise of librarians, especially in metadata and special collections, but they can take a more active stance in utilizing current library resources or vocalizing their needs for other resources. This expertise and these services can be leveraged to make the library an active and equal partner in research. Additionally, libraries should address internal issues, such as training and re-skilling librarians as necessary; better-coordinated outreach to academic departments is also needed."

            "The rapid increases in solar wind dynamic pressure, termed sudden impulses (SIs), compress Earth\u2019s dayside magnetosphere and strongly perturb the coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere (M-I) system. The compression of the dayside magnetosphere launches magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, which propagate down to the ionosphere, changing the Auroral Field Aligned Currents (FACs), and into nightside magnetosphere. The global response to the compression front sweeping through the coupled system is not yet fully understood due to the sparseness of the measurements, especially those with the necessary time resolution to resolve the propagating disturbances. That\u2019s why a study including modeling is necessary. On 15 August 2015 at 7.44 UT, Advanced Composition Explorer measured a sudden increase in the solar wind dynamic pressure from 1.11 nPa to 2.55 nPa as shown in Figure-1. \r\n\r\nWe use the magnetospheric spacecraft in the equatorial magnetosphere to identify the signatures of magnetosphere response to this SI event and examine the interaction of the propagating disturbances with the M-I system. With the increased time resolution of Active Magnetosphere and Polar Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE), the FAC pattern and intensity change due to SI can also be studied in more depth. We further use measurements from ground based magnetometer stations to increase our tracking capability for the disturbances in the ionosphere and to improve our understanding of their propagation characteristics. This is the first step in a comprehensive multi-point observation and a global magnetohydrodynamic simulation based investigation of the response of the coupled M-I system to sudden impulses.\r\n\r\n"

This research project studies and implements non-parametric kernel smoothing in Python as a way of visualizing the intensity of point patterns in space and time. A two-dimensional grid M with size mx, my is used to store the calculation result for the kernel smoothing of each grid points. The heat-map in Python then uses the grid to plot the resulting images on a map where the resolution is determined by mx and my. The resulting images also depend on a spatial and a temporal smoothing parameters, which control the resolution (smoothness) of the figure. The Python code is applied to visualize over 56,000 tornado landings in the continental U.S. from the period 1950 - 2014. The magnitudes of the tornado are based on Fujita scale."

        ],
        "Description": [
            "In a sensitive cochlea, the basilar membrane response to transient excitation of any kind--normal acoustic or artificial intracochlear excitation--consists of not only a primary impulse but also a coda of delayed secondary responses with varying amplitudes but similar spectral content around the characteristic frequency of the measurement location. The coda, sometimes referred to as echoes or ringing, has been described as a form of local, short term memory which may influence the ability of the auditory system to detect gaps in an acoustic stimulus such as speech. Depending on the individual cochlea, the temporal gap between the primary impulse and the following coda ranges from once to thrice the group delay of the primary impulse (the group delay of the primary impulse is on the order of a few hundred microseconds). The coda is physiologically vulnerable, disappearing when the cochlea is compromised even slightly. The multicomponent sensitive response is not yet completely understood.  We use a physiologically-based, mathematical model to investigate (i) the generation of the primary impulse response and the dependence of the group delay on the various stimulation methods, (ii) the effect of spatial perturbations in the properties of mechanically sensitive ion channels on the generation and separation of delayed secondary responses. The model suggests that the presence of the secondary responses depends on the wavenumber content of a perturbation and the activity level of the cochlea. In addition, the model shows that the varying temporal gaps between adjacent coda seen in experiments depend on the individual profiles of perturbations. Implications for non-invasive cochlear diagnosis are also discussed."

            "We examined the community ecology of vaginal microbial samples taken from pregnant women with previous preterm birth experience to investigate whether targeted pathogenic and commensal bacteria are related to risk of preterm birth in the current pregnancy. We found a significant correlation between the community structure of selected bacteria and birth outcome, but the correlation differed among self-reported racial/ethnic groups. Using a community ordination analysis, we observed infrequent co-occurrence of Mycoplasma and bacteria vaginosis associated bacteria 3 (BVAB3) among black and Hispanic participants. In addition, we found that the vaginal bacteria responded differently in different racial/ethnic groups to modifications of maternal behavioral (ie, douching and smoking) and biological traits (ie, body mass index [BMI]). Even after accounting for these maternal behaviors and traits, the selected vaginal bacteria was significantly associated with preterm birth among black and Hispanic participants. By contrast, white participants did not exhibit significant correlation between microbial community and birth outcome. Findings from this study affirm the necessity of considering women\u2019s race/ethnicity when evaluating the correlation between vaginal bacteria and preterm birth. The study also illustrates the importance of studying the vaginal microbiota from an ecological perspective, and demonstrates the power of ecological community analysis to improve understanding of infectious disease."

            "OBJECTIVE\u2014Genital tract infection accounts for ~ 25\u201340% of all pre-term births. We sought to\r\nassess the relationship between preterm birth and selected vaginal bacterial taxa associated with\r\npreterm birth either directly or through their association with bacterial vaginosis (BV).\r\n\r\nSTUDY DESIGN\u2014Vaginal fluid for Gram stain was collected between 17 and 22 weeks\r\ngestation as part of a randomized trial of ultrasound-indicated cerclage for preterm birth\r\nprevention in women at high risk for recurrent spontaneous preterm birth. Bacterial DNA was\r\nextracted from the Gram stain slides and analyzed using quantitative PCR.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\u2014Among the 499 participants, Mycoplasma was positively correlated with increased\r\nrisk of preterm (RR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.52,2.22) as was Mobiluncus (RR=1.36; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.73)\r\nand Atopobium (RR=1.44; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.87). However, there were strong interactions between\r\nrace/ethnic group and the presence of these and other individual taxa on risk of preterm birth. By\r\ncontrast, BVAB3 was consistently associated with a reduction in risk of preterm birth for all\r\nracial/ethnic groups (0.55; 95%CI: 0.39, 0.78).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\u2014BV is characterized by a reduction of Lactobacillus, and lactic acid\r\nproducing bacteria and the presence of Mobiluncus; we found these factors and presence of\r\nMycoplasma to be associated with increased risk of preterm birth. By contrast, the presence of a\r\nrecently identified organism sufficient to cause BV, BVAB3, decreased risk of preterm birth.\r\nThese findings give insight into why treating BV has mixed impact on risk of preterm birth."

            "We conducted a cross-sectional survey where unique respondents were treated as hypothetical patients. Each \u201cpatient\u201d was presented with two scenarios: low risk chest pain and minor traumatic brain injury. Each scenario included three variables (benefit, risk, and cost), and each variable contained four possible values. The benefit of the test was defined as the chance that the patient had a true positive finding on the test requiring medical intervention. The risk of the test was defined as the chance of developing cancer due to ionizing radiation within the next ten years. The cost was an additional out of pocket expense for the test. The survey was pilot tested on medical students and revised based on feedback.\r\nFor the benefit and risk variables, the four possible values chosen were 0.1%, 1%, 5%, and 10%. For the cost variable, the four possible values chosen were $0, $100, $500, and $1000. These values were independently randomly distributed amongst respondents, yielding 64 unique scenarios. A subset of the minor traumatic brain injury respondents who had children under the age of 18 were given another scenario, requiring them to make diagnostic testing decisions for their child. \r\nPopulation/Sample Size\r\nAdults were surveyed using Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTURK). Amazon mTurk is a crowdsourced internet marketplace that enables individuals and business to coordinate use of human intelligence to perform specific tasks. Anyone over the age of 18 with internet access was eligible to participate if they met Amazon\u2019s vetting requirements as a performer of Human Intelligence Tasks. All 1,000 surveys were completed within 1 day of posting. Each respondent has a unique identifier and account with Amazon and was unable to perform the survey more than once. We provided a reimbursement of $1 for survey completion.\r\nOutcome and Explanatory Variables\r\nThe primary outcome measured was whether the patient elected to receive testing under varying levels of benefit, risk, and cost. The following demographic information was collected: age, sex, current marital status, kids, level of education, healthcare worker or not, race, ethnicity, history of cancer, diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart attack, and overall self reported health status on a scale of 1-5.\r\nHuman Subjects Protection\r\nThis study was reviewed by the University of Michigan Institutional Review board and received a determination as exempt survey research.\r\n"

            "Introduction: Diagnostic testing is common in the emergency department. The value of some testing is questionable. The purpose of this study was to assess how varying levels of benefit, risk, and costs influenced an individual\u2019s desire to have diagnostic testing. \r\nMethods: A survey through Amazon Mechanical Turk presented hypothetical clinical situations: low risk chest pain and minor traumatic brain injury. Each scenario included three given variables (benefit, risk, and cost), that was independently randomly varied over four possible values (0.1%, 1%, 5%, 10% for benefit and risk and $0, $100, $500, and $1000 for the individual\u2019s personal cost for receiving the test). Benefit was defined as the probability of finding the target disease (traumatic intracranial hemorrhage or acute coronary syndrome).\r\nResults: A total of 1000 unique respondents completed the survey. Increasing benefit from 0.1% to 10%, the percent of respondents who accepted a diagnostic test went from 28.4% to 53.1%. [OR: 3.42 (2.57-4.54)] As risk increased from 0.1% to 10%, this number decreased from 52.5% to 28.5%. [OR: 0.33 (0.25-0.44)] Increasing cost from $0 to $1000 had the greatest change of those accepting the test from 61.1% to 21.4%, respectively. [OR: 0.15 (0.11-0.2)]\r\nConclusions: The desire for testing was strongly sensitive to the benefits, risks and costs. Many participants wanted a test when there was no added cost, regardless of benefit or risk levels, but far fewer elected to receive the test as cost increased incrementally. This suggests that out of pocket costs may deter patients from undergoing diagnostic testing with low potential benefit.\r\n"

            "Transcriptional accessibility of chromatin is central to guiding CD4+ T cell function through regulation of lineage specific gene expression. Myst1 is a histone acetyltransferase responsible for acetylation of the protein tail of histone 4 at lysine residue 16 (H416ac), resulting in increased transcriptional accessibility and activation of gene transcription. Previous studies have described a role for Myst1 in governing lymphocyte development in the thymus, however the role of Myst1 and H4K16ac in guiding activation of peripheral CD4+ T cells has not been studied. Activation of human and murine CD4+ T cells resulted in upregulation of Myst1 expression, and deletion of Myst1 resulted in changes in proliferative responses to both polyclonal stimulus and exogenous cytokines.  Myst1-deficient T cells also exhibited modulations in lineage commitment, with decreased function in TH1/TH2 skewing conditions and increased function in response to TH17-promoting conditions. Regulation of Myst1 function in CD4+ T cells appears governed at least in part by STAT5, as Myst1 expression is regulated by STAT5 expression and DNA binding, and modulations in H4K16ac in Myst1-deficient CD4+ T cells is observable at sites in the promoter regions of lineage specific genes following skewing to the TH1 or TH2 lineage in vitro. Taken together, these results indicate an important role for the STAT5-Myst1 epigenetic axis in governing the activation and effector function of CD4+ T cells. "

            "1. Background\r\nThe use of response adaptive randomization (RAR) is becoming more common in clinical trials (Journal of Clinical Oncology. 2011;29(6):606-609). Such designs will change the randomization ratio based on information on treatment effect that accumulates within the trial (this is done in the background and not by unblinding the investigators). This has the effect of increasing the number of patients who are assigned to the better performing treatment arm. \r\nAcute care research represents an area where this may be of particular benefit, since few effective treatments exist for many emergency conditions such as stroke. Within such high stakes diseases, it may be advantageous to have a trial designed to improve the overall outcomes (on the average) of the population enrolled by tilting randomization towards the better treatment (which could be the placebo/standard treatment or the experimental treatment) (JAMA. 2012;307(22):2377-2378).\r\nPrevious work by this research team focused on the impact of surrogate consent on acute care research. (BMC Emergency Medicine 2013, 13:18) In the summer of 2011, 400 emergency department patients and their family members at the University of Michigan were interviewed and rated their willingness to participate in 5 treatment and research options in the event of a future, hypothetical stroke. Two of the scenarios described an acute stroke trial with or without response adaptive randomization. While not the primary focus of that research study, 58% of the subjects agreed to the trial with response adaptive randomization, and 21% agreed to the standard clinical trial with fixed randomization. From this previous work, we learned that it would be ideal to more comprehensively describe the research trial to hypothetical patients and simulate the process that is used in actual acute trial enrollments as much as possible. \r\nThis informed our follow up study that occurred in the summer of 2012. We presented a hypothetical stroke scenario to 418 subjects presenting to the emergency department for other, non-critical complaints. Half the subjects were presented a hypothetical clinical trial with standard 1:1 randomization, and half the subjects were presented a trial with RAR. There was significantly higher participation in the RAR trial (67.3%) versus the standard trial (54.5%), absolute increase: 12.8% (95% CI: 3.7 to 22.2%). Interestingly, only 62% of the RAR group versus 85% of the standard randomization group were able to accurately identify the allocation procedure when queried at the end of the scenario. The overarching goal of this investigation is to adjust the brief trial description procedure to improve understanding of the trial allocation procedure for the RAR. Improving the communication of the trial procedures within a simulated situation that mimics the rapid discussion regarding an emergency research trial would be beneficial for future interventional research studies in acute stroke and other serious emergent conditions.\r\n2. Specific Aims\r\n1. To measure the impact of adding in brief questions for comprehension into the consent process of a simulated emergency stroke trial with the intent of maximizing understanding of the randomization procedure.\r\n2. To determine if hypothetical trial participation is increased by the addition of the understanding questions to the consent process.\r\n3. To explore the thematics areas expressed in the questions that the research participants have regarding the hypothetical trial.\r\n3. Design\r\nCross sectional survey of convenience sample of ED patients and their family members without stroke with random allocation to two hypothetical clinical trials. \r\n4. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria\r\nPatients or family members must be age 18 or greater. They must agree to participate in study. Patients must be presenting to ED without stroke or alteration in mental status, with stable vital signs and also not located in a resuscitation bay. Patients in any isolation status (contact, droplet, etc) were not approached).\r\n5. Survey Procedures\r\nPatients will be screened in the emergency department based on chief complaint and vital signs from the emergency department information system Centricity or MiChart. If eligible, patients will be asked to participate after a brief description of the study by a co-investigator, consented, and interviewed in the emergency department.  In order to better simulate an at-risk stroke population, the oldest patients in the ED at any given time will be screened first.\r\nVerbal consent will be obtained from the patient to participate in the simulation and they will receive a handout regarding their research participation and its voluntary nature. Since this is minimal risk research, and the informed consent form would represent the collection of personal identifiers, formal written informed consent will not be obtained.\r\nIf the patient\u2019s eligible family member(s) also wish to participate they will be asked to leave the area while the scenario is being administered to the patient.\r\n\r\n\u2003\r\n\r\nAfter consent is obtained, the patient will be randomized to one of  four groups: either receiving a scenario with the RAR trial or the standard clinical trial with or without the addition of comprehension questions. (The two groups without the addition of the comprehension questions will be exposed to the same procedure as the 418 patients from the 2012 study.)\r\n\r\nGroup\tTrial Type\tVideo Type\tProportion\tN from 2012\tN from 2014\r\n1\tRAR\tUninterrupted\t25%\t208\t75\r\n2\tStandard\tUninterrupted\t8.33%\t210\t25\r\n3\tRAR\tComprehension\t50%\t0\t150\r\n4\tStandard\tComprehension\t16.67%\t0\t50\r\n\r\nFour comprehension questions will be added to the videos for the two groups assigned to this intervention, all addressing research procedures relevant to the consent process and operation of the the trial. One of the questions specifically addresses the method of randomization and allocation. Details are found in appendix 2. The following items will be available to the subjects (depending on scenario): consent form for standard trial, consent form for RAR trial, and risk pictograph for stroke thombolysis (Stroke. 2010; 41(2): 300\u2013306).\r\nThe clinical scenario and all other aspects of the trial will be exactly the same. The patient will be told during this scenario that \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d and that a decision needs to be made quickly, in an attempt to simulate the acute trial enrollment process for stroke. Randomization will occur in blocks of 4 and 8, in order to maintain general numerical balance between the groups throughout the study. In addition, if the patient has a family member or other visitor present they will be asked to refrain from discussing the decision with the patient until after the scenario and data collection are completed. \r\n\r\nA detailed hypothetical trial protocol will be available to the investigators as a reference regarding questions that the research participant may ask; however the interviewer(s) will have reviewed the protocol extensively and have pilot tested the scenario and should be well equipped to answer nearly all potential questions regarding the hypothetical clinical trial. Notes will be taken regarding the patient\u2019s questions regarding the research trial. In addition, the amount of time spent on questions will be captured as a continuous variable. \r\nA structured survey will be administered which asks whether the patient agrees to the hypothetical trial, along with demographics, stroke warning signs, along with a modified version of the ICQ-4 (which excludes the fourth item which asks whether the study met expectations which would not be applicable for this hypothetical study \u2013 since they did not participate) instrument to assess adequacy of informed consent (Journal of Clinical Epidemiology. 2006;59(6):608-614). The participant will receive a handout on stroke warning signs at the end of the research procedures.\r\nAt the end of this survey participation in the research will end and no follow up contact will be conducted.\r\nNo protected health information or any other specific identifiers will be collected from the patients. \r\nThe data collection / scenario instrument will be pilot tested in the spring and adjusted as necessary.\r\nData collection for the project will proceed over the summer months.\r\nThe research assistant (medical student) who is collecting the data will not have access to results within the database during the data collection phase.\r\n6. Analysis Plan\r\nAim 1: The primary outcome will be difference in proportions for correct identification of the hypothetical trial allocation method between the comprehension questions (intervention) group versus the uninterrupted video group limited to the subjects assigned to the RAR groups. For the primary analysis, the 218 subjects from the 2012 study assigned to the RAR group will be included in the analysis. These 218 subjects will be fully weighted unless a chi-square test comparing the proportion correctly identifying the allocation methods from the 2012 study versus the \u201cuninterrupted video\u201d  group from the 2014 study indicates a significant difference between groups. In this case, for the primary analysis, each of the 2012 subjects will be weighted as 0.25 of an observation, thus placing approximately equal weight on the 2014 and 2012 subjects. Since these subjects are being exposed to exactly the same research procedure, we anticipate that there will not be heterogeneity and the subjects will be fully included in this analysis. As a pre-planned secondary analysis we will use multivariable logistic regression to estimate the adjusted odds of correctly identifying the allocation method within the RAR group, and include the following covariates based on our a priori belief about potential confounders: age, sex, ethnicity, and education.\r\nAim 2: The pre-planned secondary outcome will be a difference in differences analysis. The outcome of interest here will be participation in hypothetical trial (same primary outcome as 2012). Proportions and 95% confidence intervals for each of the four groups will be calculated with 2014 and 2012 groups (uninterrupted video) combined. The subjects from each of the 2012 groups included in this analysis will be fully weighted, unless a chi-square test indicates heterogeneity. (RAR uninterrupted 2014 versus RAR 2012; Standard-uninterrupted 2014 versus standard 2012).  Logistic regression will be conducted with the following indicator variables as covariates: RAR trial versus standard, comprehension video versus uninterrupted, and interaction term. In addition, an adjusted model will be fitted including additional  covariates were all included in the model based on our a priori belief about potential confounders: age, sex, ethnicity, education, self-reported understanding of protocol, ability to correctly identify allocation technique and stroke awareness.\r\nDescriptive statistics for demographics and stroke knowledge will be calculated.\r\n\r\nSummary scores based in the ICQ-4 scale will also be calculated and comparisons will be made for trial accepters comparing the standard group and the RAR trial group.\r\n7. Sample Size\r\nWe plan to enroll approximately 300 subjects. This should be feasible as 418 interviews were conducted during the previous summer and the current protocol is not significantly lengthened in terms of time. \r\nThe correct identification proportion in the 2012 study was about 62%. If we have 150 new subjects in the comprehension questions group, and 75 new subjects in the uninterrupted video group (added to the 208 from 2012), we will have 90% power at the 0.05 significance level to detect an increase in the correct identification proportion to 77%, which would be clinically meaningful. (For reference, the standard randomization or \u201ccoin-flip\u201d group correctly identified the randomization technique 85% of the time.)\r\nThere is no pre-specified maximum number of subjects as this is a time-limited summer project. At the end of the 9th week (out of ten) enrollment of new subjects will terminate, unless the total sample size is not at least 300 subjects. \r\nThe patients will be randomized in randomly permuted blocks (sizes 12 and 24) to ensure ongoing balance between the 4 groups. The randomization scheme was generated by using the Web site Randomization.com \u27e8http://www.randomization.com\u27e9. The research assistant will only be able to access the assignment of the current patient, in order to properly administer the scenario. \r\n\r\n\u2003\r\n\r\nAppendix 1: Recruitment Script\r\nStudy Title: Consent in Hypothetical Acute Stroke Treatment\r\nStudy Information\r\nWe are conducting a research study to determine your preferences regarding acute stroke treatment and research. This study is completely voluntary and you can choose not to participate without any loss of potential benefits.\r\nThere is no compensation for this study. You will receive a brief review of stroke warning signs as part of your participation.\r\nThis study will take about 15 minutes of your time. You can choose not to answer any questions you are not comfortable answering. \u00ad\u00ad\u00adWe will ask you to identify stroke warning signs. We will describe a situation in which you have a stroke, and then we will present a hypothetical research study. We will ask you whether you would participate in this research study. We will also allow you to ask questions about the hypothetical research study and then ask you some questions regarding the adequacy of the informed consent process for the hypothetical stroke study.\r\nWe will then ask you several questions on demographics. At the end of the discussion, your participation will be completed. We will not collect any data which is personally identifiable to you. To ensure there is no chance that we inadvertently disclose documents that can identify you, we will NOT have you sign a consent form for this study (as this would create a document that has your identity). We will review stroke warning signs and provide you with an informational handout from the American Stroke Association. This study is funded by the University of Michigan Medical School. \r\nFor questions about this study, please contact Dr. William J. Meurer, MD, MS:\r\nAlfred Taubman Health Care Center\r\n1500 East Medical Center Drive\r\nRoom B1354\r\nAnn Arbor, MI 48109-5303\r\nPhone: 734-615-2766\r\nEmail: wmeurer@umich.edu\r\n\r\nAppendix 2: Script for video\r\nThe added elements for the new comprehension questions are underlined below and only subjects randomized to these scenarios will be exposed to the comprehension questions. The RAR video can be viewed at http://youtu.be/cKIWduCaPZc; the standard trial video can be viewed at http://youtu.be/SrI4FdCTZ-A.\r\nScenario\r\nAfter agreeing to participate, the participant will be randomized to being offered RAR versus standard trial.  \r\nOverview\r\nPart 1: Introduction\r\nYou have just suffered a stroke. Without warning, you are unable to move the right side of your body (arm or leg) and are unable to talk. You are also unable to understand what others are saying. You have been taken to the nearest emergency department and doctors have done tests and determined that this condition has been caused by a clot in one of the blood vessels in your brain. We will now describe several possible treatment options.  We want you to consider participating in this hypothetical trial, and ask questions that you would need answered if this was really occurring. We will provide an overview of the study and the alternative, standard treatment. We will also go over the hypothetical consent form for this study with you. You will then tell us whether you would want to participate in this study. Even though this scenario describes a situation in which you will not be able to talk, please answer the questions we will ask at the end regarding research participation and your understanding of the research protocol.\r\nIMPORTANT: If you have visitors with you, you may ask them to leave while we do this if you wish. However, it is important that you do not consult with your family members or friends during the scenario. Your family members and friends are also NOT allowed to ask questions regarding the protocol while we are collecting data. When the scenario is finished and we have completed data collection, we encourage you to talk with your family members or friends regarding these types of decisions, and we will attempt to answer any questions. We do recognize that in the event we are attempting to simulate, your family members would likely be very involved in the decision making process \u2013 however their task would be helping the researchers and physicians with choosing the treatment or research participation that YOU would want \u2013 which is why we are focusing on your opinions in this study.   \r\nYou should have a copy of the consent form for this study with you for your reference.\r\nPart 2: Overview \u2013 Standard Treatment Drug tPA\r\nFollowing the stroke, you are a candidate for the standard treatment for a stroke, a drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). This drug, tPA, has been FDA approved to reduce disability following stroke since 1996 and has been used extensively. It works by dissolving clots in the blood vessels of the brain. The original trial was funded by the U.S. government, and it is now recommended by the American Heart Association.\r\nWhen tPA is administered, for every 100 patients treated, about 13 extra patients would be left with no disability at 3 months when this drug is compared to receiving no acute treatment. By no disability we mean you would be able to walk on your own, care for yourself and return to work or other leisure activities that you enjoy. However, there is a small risk: about 6 out of every 100 patients treated with tPA will develop serious bleeding. Serious bleeding may include bleeding in the brain that could make symptoms worse or other bleeding that may require a transfusion. Still, there is no difference in the chance of dying whether you receive tPA or not.\r\nComprehension question 1 is presented:\r\nPlease choose the most appropriate option:\r\ntPA was previously demonstrated to do what?\r\nA. Reduce disability in selected stroke patients\r\nB. Save lives\r\nC. I don\u2019t know\r\nThe research subject is provided feedback on the correct answer after making a selection. (Answer A.)\r\nPart 3: Overview \u2013 Experimental Drug XPA\r\nThe drug that is being investigated by this clinical research trial is an experimental drug, called XPA, or experimental plasminogen activator.  It has been used extensively for patients with heart attacks and is just now being investigated in patients with stroke. tPA (the standard treatment for stroke) was also previously used in heart attack patients prior to being approved for use in stroke.  This trial is being funded by the U.S. government, and it is designed to answer the question of whether XPA is potentially better and safer than the current standard treatment tPA. The reason we are doing the trial is because we are truly uncertain whether XPA is better than tPA. We have studied this drug in other people with stroke in a smaller trial. It appeared as safe as tPA in stroke patients and was promising \u2013 we are doing this larger trial to determine if it is actually better.\r\nComprehension question 2 is presented:\r\nPlease choose the most appropriate option:\r\nWho is providing the money to do this research study on stroke?\r\nA. The drug company\r\nB. The U.S. government\r\nC. Medical insurance companies\r\nD. The hospital\r\nE. I don\u2019t know\r\nThe research subject is provided feedback on the correct answer after making a selection. (Answer: B)\r\nPart 4a: Standard Trial Script (skip to RAR trial Script if subject randomized to this)\r\nIf you are watching this, the investigators in the hospital have reviewed your medical history and performed a complete neurological exam to ensure that you are a candidate for this study.\r\nIf you choose NOT to enroll in the clinical research trial of XPA, you will instead have the following options: 1) Treatment with standard dose tPA given by IV; or 2) No immediate treatment for the stroke. You will still be admitted to the hospital and receive all other appropriate stroke therapies including physical therapy and speech therapy as necessary.\r\nIf you choose to enroll in the clinical research trial of XPA, you will have a 50:50 chance of either receiving tPA (the standard treatment) or XPA (the new treatment). This will be determined by a computer and is similar to flipping a coin. This type of randomization is important to make sure that the groups receiving each of the medications are similar in every way, other than which treatment they receive.\r\nComprehension question 3a is presented:\r\nPlease choose the most appropriate option:\r\nWho or what decides what treatment I get (xPA or tPA) in this trial?\r\nA. Randomization (something like a coin flip, with equal 50% chance of getting either for any individual in the trial including me)\r\nB. An algorithm informed by how well previous patients have done in this study, that still has some randomness (but might be like flipping a coin with an 80% chance of heads)\r\nC. The team of doctors and researchers caring for me will evaluate all available information and decide.\r\nD. I don\u2019t know\r\nThe research subject is provided feedback on the correct answer after making a selection (The correct response in this case is A.)\r\nIn addition, in this trial, there will be a 3 month follow up to track how you are doing.  You will be free to leave the study at any time, without penalty, but your reasons for leaving may be kept as part of the study record. The study will pay for research-related items and services.  However, you will not receive any compensation or benefits from participating, but we hope the information learned from this research study will help medical professionals understand how to help patients with stroke in the future.\r\n\r\nPart 4b: RAR Trial Script (don\u2019t read if subject randomized to standard trial script)\r\nIf you are watching this, the investigators in the hospital have reviewed your medical history and performed a complete neurological exam to ensure that you are a candidate for this study.\r\nIf you choose NOT to enroll in the clinical research trial of XPA, you will instead have the following options: 1) Treatment with standard dose tPA given by IV; or 2) No immediate treatment for the stroke. You will still be admitted to the hospital and receive all other appropriate stroke therapies including physical therapy and speech therapy as necessary.\r\nIf you choose to enroll in the clinical research trial of XPA, you will either receive tPA (the standard treatment) or XPA (the new treatment).  The chances of you receiving tPA or XPA will vary depending on which treatment has shown so far to be the best in reducing disability in patients similar to yourself so far in our study.  If no difference has been shown between the treatments so far in the study, you will have a 50:50 chance of receiving XPA versus tPA.  However, depending on how much better either treatment is doing within those patients in whom we already have results, you may have as high as an 80:20 chance of receiving the better performing treatment.  At this point in time, across the U.S. approximately half of the total planned 700 patients have been enrolled. All of the researchers are blinded from the data of patients already enrolled, and the distribution of the better treatment is being determined by a computer that analyzes the ongoing results.\r\nComprehension question 3b is presented:\r\nPlease choose the most appropriate option:\r\nWho or what decides what treatment I get (xPA or tPA) in this trial?\r\nA. Randomization (something like a coin flip, with equal 50% chance of getting either for any individual in the trial including me)\r\nB. An algorithm informed by how well previous patients have done in this study, that still has some randomness (but might be like flipping a coin with an 80% chance of heads)\r\nC. The team of doctors and researchers caring for me will evaluate all available information and decide.\r\nD. I don\u2019t know\r\nThe research subject is provided feedback on the correct answer after making a selection (The correct response in this case is B.)\r\nIn addition, in this trial, there will be a 3 month follow up to track how you are doing.  You will be free to leave the study at any time, without penalty, but your reasons for leaving may be kept as part of the study record. The study will pay for research-related items and services.  However, you will not receive any compensation or benefits from participating, but we hope the information learned from this research study will help medical professionals understand how to help patients with stroke in the future.\r\nPart 5: Conclusions\r\nThe XPA research study is funded by the National Institutes of Health and was designed by stroke researchers at the University of Saline. The companies whose products are being studied may benefit if the study demonstrates that this treatment combination is helpful. Saline Ann Arbor Pharmaceuticals are providing the study medications, but are not involved in the design of this research or the decision to publish results. \r\nComprehension question 4 is presented:\r\nPlease choose the most appropriate option:\r\nWhat are the benefits of participating in this trial?\r\nA. The satisfaction of knowing that my participation is informing the care of future patients.\r\nB. Monetary compensation that will be paid directly to me by the researchers.\r\nC. I will definitely receive the superior treatment based on the described study procedures.\r\nD. I don\u2019t know\r\nThe research subject is provided feedback on the correct answer after making a selection (The correct response in this case is A.)\r\nThis is the end of the video. You will now be asked some questions by the research assistant.\r\n\r\n\u2003\r\n\r\nAppendix 3: Data Collection\r\nRAR-HypotheticalVersion1\r\n \r\nQ26 Enter Subject Number\r\n \r\nQ4 Please name as many stroke warning signs as you can.

            "This is a cross-sectional survey of the effect of varying levels of benefit, risk, and cost of diagnostic testing on the probability of electing to pursue testing in two hypothetical clinical scenarios among a convenience sample of patients in the University of Michigan Emergency Department (ED). Study designParticipants were presented with two hypothetical clinical scenarios, in random order, in which they present to the ED with either low-risk chest pain (CP) or minor traumatic brain injury (mTBI). A subset of the mTBI respondents with children under the age of 18 were given a similar scenario with their child as the patient (mTBI-child) instead of themselves (mTBI-adult). A structured survey was then administered in which participants were asked to decide if they would pursue diagnostic testing given different levels of benefit (the chance of having an accurate diagnosis of disease requiring medical intervention), risk (the development of cancer within ten years due to ionizing radiation from the test), and cost (an additional test-specific copay) associated with the diagnostic test. The survey was read aloud to all patients to reduce any misunderstandings caused by difficulties with reading or seeing. Participants responded to both clinical scenarios and were randomly assigned a benefit and risk value of 0.1% or 1%, and a cost of $0 or $100 for the diagnostic test. These values were chosen to maximize the sensitivity of the study to detect differences in patient preferences based on a preliminary study performed by the authors (mTURK methods paper et al), which indicated that the largest variation in patients accepting or declining diagnostic testing was for benefit and risk levels of 0.1% and 1% and cost levels of $0 and $100. Additionally, risk values of 0.1% and 1% were felt to represent a realistic chance of developing cancer from diagnostic testing with radiation (Factor, Acetylhydrolase, & Levy, 2008). In order to improve participants\u2019\r\nincorporation of numerical values into their decision-making (Schapira, Nattinger, & McAuliffe, 2006), patients were presented with decision aids where risk and benefit values were presented as a ratio and percentage, as well as with an image representing values of 1 in 1000 and 1 in 100. The full transcript of the scenarios and survey is available in the online appendix. Setting and ParticipantsA convenience sample of adult patients over the age of 18 who presented to the University of Michigan ED during the daytime hours between June and August 2015 were recruited in the study until 900 completed surveys were achieved. Patients presenting with chest pain or recent head injury were not recruited so as to not interfere with their clinical course. Additionally, patients who were under contact precautions or in resuscitation bays were not approached. No compensation was offered for completion.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

All animal-related procedures were performed in compliance with the University of Michigan guidelines for the humane use of animals. MEFs and HEK293T cells were cultured as described previously (Yoshida et al., 2011). MEFs from TSC2-knockout (Zhang et al., 2003) and WT control mice were provided by D. Kwiatkowski (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The plasmid pIRES-mCFP was constructed by replacing the EGFP sequence of pIRES-EGFP (BD Biosciences) and the PCR-amplified mCFP sequence between BstX1 and Not1. Rac-WT and Rac-N17 sequences were PCR amplified and subcloned into the pIRES-mCFP between Nhe1 and EcoR1 sites, resulting in the plasmids pRac1-WT-IRES2-mCFP and pRac1-N17-IRES2-mCFP, respectively. The plasmid pmCitrine-BtkPH-N1 was described previously (Kamen et al., 2007; Yoshida et al., 2015). In brief, the PCR-amplified BtkPH sequence was subcloned into the pmCitrine-N1 vector (Clontech) between XhoI and HindIII. The plasmid pC 1\u03b4-YFP was a gift from T. Meyer (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA). The plasmid pEGFP-N1 was from Clontech. The plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.G were from Addgene. The plasmids pRac1-WT-IRES2-mCFP and pRac1-N17-IRES2-mCFP were derived from pIRES2-EGFP vector (BD Biosciences). The plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.G were described previously (Suzuki et al., 2013).\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneration of Rac1 knockout MEFs using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing\r\n\r\nThe 20-nt guide sequence targeting mouse Rac1 was designed using the CRISPR design tool. The guide RNA (gRNA) encoding DNA was cloned into a bicistronic expression vector (LentiCRISPR v2; a gift from F. Zhang (Broad Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA); and plasmid 52961; Addgene) containing human codon\u2013optimized Cas9 and the RNA components (Sanjana et al., 2014). The guiding sequence, with a 3-nt protospacer adjacent motif, targets exon 2 of mouse Rac1 gene: 5\u2032-ACGGTGGGGATGTACTCTCCAGG-3\u2032. As a control, a gRNA sequence targeting GFP was designed (5\u2032-CATGCCTGAAGGTTATGTAC-3\u2032). The LentiCRISPR vectors with different gRNAs were transfected into HEK293T cells with lentiviral packaging plasmid psPAX2 and envelope plasmid pMD2.G. The virus was collected and concentrated as described previously (Suzuki et al., 2013). MEF3 cells (a gift from L. Kotula, Upstate Medical School, Rochester, NY) were used as WT MEFs. 24 h after infection, the cells were selected for resistance to 5 \u00b5g/ml puromycin for 48 h. At day 6 after infection, the cells were examined for Rac1 expression and used for further experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nCell treatments\r\n\r\nFor the biochemical assays, BMMs and MEFs were cultured in DMEM (low glucose; 11885; Life Technologies) without FBS overnight. BMMs were stimulated with M-CSF (6.9 nM) or PMA (100 nM) for the indicated times and lysates were prepared for Western blotting as described previously (Yoshida et al., 2011). For inhibitor treatment assays, BMMs were pretreated with U0126 (10 \u00b5M), A66 (3 \u00b5M), IC87114 (0.1\u20131 \u00b5M), MK2206 (2 \u00b5M), or EIPA (25 \u00b5M) for 30 min in DMEM, HBSS, or DPBS containing leucine or glucose. A combination of blebbistatin (75 \u00b5M for 35 min) and jasplakinolide (1 \u00b5M for 15 min) was also used. After treatments, cells were stimulated by M-CSF or PMA for 5 or 30 min, respectively. For calphostin C treatment, cells were pretreated with 500 nM calphostin C for 20 min in a CO2 incubator and transferred into a biological safety cabinet for light activation for another 10 min (Bruns et al., 1991). For leucine or glucose stimulation assays, BMMs were treated with DPBS with leucine or glucose at the indicated concentrations for 35 min (for blebbistatin and jasplakinolide experiments) or 50 min and stimulated by M-CSF or PMA for another 5 min or 30 min, respectively. MEFs were starved in DPBS with leucine (0.4 mM) or glucose (5.6 mM) for 30 min and stimulated with PDGF (2 nM) for 15 min (Gao et al., 2007). For inhibitor treatment assays, MEFs were pretreated 30 min with EIPA (25 \u00b5M) or the JB combination. For PDGF and leucine stimulation assays, MEFs were incubated in DPBS with glucose (5.6 mM) throughout, including 50 min starvation followed by stimulation for 10 min with PDGF and/or leucine (0.4 mM). For the dipeptide assay, MEFs were cultured in DPBS or DPBS with Ala-Leu (4.0 mM) for 30 min and stimulated by PDGF for another 30 min. For amino acid stimulation assays, BMMs or MEFs were incubated in HBSS (Life Technologies) for 50 min and then DMEM for 5 min with or without M-CSF (BMMs), or 10 min with or without PDGF (MEFs).\r\n\r\n\r\nWestern blotting\r\n\r\nCells were lysed 10 min in ice-cold lysis buffer (40 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM pyrophosphate, 10 mM glycerophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 1.5 mM Na3VO4, 0.3% CHAPS, and a mixture of protease inhibitors; Roche) as reported previously (Yoshida et al., 2011). Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatant was mixed with 4\u00d7 SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and applied to Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. At least two independent experiments were performed to confirm the results of pilot studies.\r\n\r\n\r\nMicroscopy\r\n\r\nPhase-contrast and fluorescence microscopic images were collected in an Eclipse TE-300 inverted microscope with a 60\u00d7 NA1.4, oil-immersion PlanApo objective lens (Nikon) and a Lambda LS xenon arc lamp for epifluorescence illumination (Sutter Instruments). Fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths were selected using a 69008 set (Chroma Technology) and a Lambda 10\u20132 filter wheel controller (Shutter Instruments) equipped with a shutter for epifluorescence illumination control. Images were recorded with a Photometrics CoolSnap HQ cooled charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific).\r\n\r\nFor live cell imaging, cells plated onto glass-bottom, 35-mm diameter dishes (MatTek Corp.) were preloaded by endocytosis of TRDx (0.5 mg/ml \u00d7 2\u20133 h) followed by a 2- to 4-h chase in unlabeled medium. Cells were first imaged in Ringer\u2019s buffer (RB; 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 155 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM NaH2PO4, and 10 mM glucose; 23\u00b0C), then stimulated with 200 ng/ml M-CSF in RB to stimulate macropinocytosis, with added LY, rinsed, transferred to the microscope, and imaged at 20-s intervals. Images were processed as video or still sequences using MetaMorph software. To confirm the results of live cell imaging, three or more independent experiments were performed.\r\n\r\nImmunofluorescence staining for BMMs was performed as described previously (Racoosin and Swanson, 1993). In brief, cells were washed three times with 37\u00b0C RB and fixed for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with fixation buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 2% PFA, 4.5% sucrose, 70 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 70 mM lysine-HCl, and 10 mM sodium periodate). The fixed cells were rinsed with washing buffer (TBS buffer: 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4.5% sucrose) for 3 \u00d7 5 min, permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 20 s and then incubated with blocking buffer (TBS buffer with 2% goat serum) for 30 min at RT. Immunofluorescence staining for MEFs was performed as described previously (Yoshida et al., 2011). The fixed cells were rinsed with DPBS for 3 \u00d7 5 min, permeabilized with 0.01% saponin in DPBS for 10 min at RT then blocked with blocking buffer (TBS buffer; 0.01% Triton X-100, and 2% BSA) for 30 min at RT. Samples were incubated with primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:100 in blocking buffer at RT for 2 h. After rinsing three times with TBS buffer, samples were incubated with secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:200 in blocking buffer at RT for 2 h. After rinsing three times with TBS buffer, samples were mounted on microscope slides using Prolong Gold (Life Technologies). To confirm qualitative observations, quantitative analysis was applied to 10 or more immunofluorescence images.\r\n\r\n\r\nMacropinosome assay\r\n\r\nTo measure macropinocytosis, cells on coverslips were pulse labeled for the indicated times with LY (1 mg/ml) or FDx70 (1.2 mg/ml) in medium containing M-CSF, PDGF, or PMA and then were rinsed, fixed, and observed using a Nikon TE300 fluorescence microscope. Uningested probes were removed by gently washing with DPBS before cells were fixed for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with fixation buffer. Phase-contrast and FDx70 or LY fluorescence images of fixed cells were captured and merged after reducing background signal using MetaMorph (version 6.3; Molecular Devices). The number of induced macropinosomes per cell was determined by counting FDx70- or LY-positive vesicles on the merged images; >25 cells were observed for each assay.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuantitative analysis of mTOR-LAMP colocalization\r\n\r\nPhase-contrast and mTOR and LAMP-1 immunofluorescence images were taken of BMMs containing tubular endolysosome structures. More than 49 BMM images from five independent experiments were observed per condition, and the frequency of the cells showing mTOR\u2013LAMP-1 was determined by comparing mTOR, LAMP-1, and merge images using MetaMorph. Data were analyzed by the t test. To analyze colocalization in MEFs, pilot experiments were followed by one experiment in which >10 MEF images per condition were randomly captured, and LAMP-1 and mTOR images were compared using the \u201cMeasure Colocalization\u201d command in MetaMorph, after thresholding each image to reduce background signals. We calculated the area of mTOR-LAMP colocalization divided by the area of LAMP, and the result was considered as the frequency of mTOR\u2013LAMP-1 colocalization in this study. Identical methods were used to quantify colocalization of mTOR with LY. All data were analyzed by the t test.\r\n\r\n\r\nRatiometric imaging\r\n\r\nCells were prepared for live cell imaging as described by Yoshida et al. (2009). A ratiometric imaging approach was used to measure the ratios of two fluorescent chimeras in BMMs, using MetaMorph software as described previously (Swanson, 2002; Hoppe and Swanson, 2004; Yoshida et al., 2009; Welliver and Swanson, 2012). Ratio images reported the concentrations of YFP-BktPH relative to CFP, to localize PIP3, and of YFP-C1\u03b4 relative to CFP, to localize DAG, thereby correcting for variations in optical path length owing to cell shape. Ratio images of LY and TRDx reported the relative distributions of the two dyes in endocytic compartments. All observations were repeated >10 times.\r\n\r\n\r\nLY endocytosis\r\n\r\nLY was used to investigate the trafficking of small solutes ingested by macropinocytosis. For time course experiments, cells were incubated in DMEM or HBSS with 1 mg/ml LY for 1, 5, or 10 min, with or without M-CSF, and then rinsed three times before fixation. For colocalization assays, cells were stained for immunofluorescence with anti\u2013LAMP or anti\u2013mTOR antibodies. For Rac1 expression experiments, BMMs were transfected with plasmids encoding pRac1-WT-IRES2-mCFP or pRac1-N17-IRES2-mCFP, using a Mouse Macrophage Nucleofector kit (Amaxa). Cells were incubated for 24 h and used for the LY assay. For starvation assays, cells were incubated in HBSS for 30 min before 10-min M-CSF stimulation. To quantify the amount of ingested LY, phase-contrast and LY images were taken and shade/bias corrections were applied (Hoppe, 2007). More than 10 cell images per condition were captured on three separate days, and the total intensity of LY inside each cell was obtained using the \u201cMeasure\u201d tool in MetaMorph, after thresholding each image to subtract background signals. To quantify the frequency of mTOR-LY colocalization, phase-contrast, mTOR, and LY images were taken and shade/bias corrections were applied. More than 10 cell images per condition were captured. The frequency of the integrated signal of mTOR (or LY) overlapping of LY (or mTOR) inside of a cell was measured as the frequency of mTOR-LY colocalization using the \u201cMeasure Colocalization\u201d tool in MetaMorph. Because we used CFP as a marker for cells overexpressing Rac1 or Rac1(N17), we corrected the LY fluorescence image (IF: excitation 430/424; emission 535/530) for crossover signal from CFP (ICFP: excitation 430/424; emission 470/424). Crossover fluorescence was corrected by measuring the coefficient \u03b2 from cells expressing CFP only (IF/ICFP) and isolating the LY fluorescence from cells containing LY and CFP, using the equation ILY = IF \u2212 \u03b2ICFP (Hoppe, 2007). All data were analyzed by the t test.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetail of statistical methods\r\n\r\nAll experimental replicates subsequent to pilot studies are presented here. In scoring for macropinosome formation (Fig. 2, B\u2013F; Fig. 3, A\u2013D and H; Fig. 4, A\u2013G; Fig. 5 B; Fig. 6 I; Fig. S2 C; Fig. S3, C and E; and Fig. S4 F), a one-tailed, paired t test was applied to data obtained from three technical replicates of samples with 15 or more cells for each condition. For mTOR-LAMP colocalization analysis in BMMs (Fig. S4 C), a two-tailed, paired t test was applied to five technical replicates of samples with seven or more cells for each condition. For analysis of mTOR recruitment to macropinosomes (Fig. S4 G), a one-tailed, paired t test was applied to data obtained from three technical replicates of samples with 25 or more macropinosomes for each condition. For mTOR-LAMP colocalization analysis in MEFs (Fig. S5, B, E, and G) and mTOR-LY colocalization analysis in BMMs (Fig. 6, H, K, and M), a one-tailed, two-sample unequal variance t test was applied to images of 10 or more cells for each condition. For analysis of integrated intensity of LY in BMMs (Fig. 6, D, J, and L), a one-tailed, two-sample unequal variance t test was applied to images of 10 or more cells for each condition.\r\n"

            "The rapid activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1) by growth factors is increased by extracellular amino acids through yet-undefined mechanisms of amino acid transfer into endolysosomes. Because the endocytic process of macropinocytosis concentrates extracellular solutes into endolysosomes and is increased in cells stimulated by growth factors or tumor-promoting phorbol esters, we analyzed its role in amino acid\u2013dependent activation of mTORC1. Here, we show that growth factor-dependent activation of mTORC1 by amino acids, but not glucose, requires macropinocytosis. In murine bone marrow\u2013derived macrophages and murine embryonic fibroblasts stimulated with their cognate growth factors or with phorbol myristate acetate, activation of mTORC1 required an Akt-independent vesicular pathway of amino acid delivery into endolysosomes, mediated by the actin cytoskeleton. Macropinocytosis delivered small, fluorescent fluid-phase solutes into endolysosomes sufficiently fast to explain growth factor\u2013mediated signaling by amino acids. Therefore, the amino acid\u2013laden macropinosome is an essential and discrete unit of growth factor receptor signaling to mTORC1"

Two tables are provided. Table 1 lists the names of the peptides and their corresponding sequences. Table 2 lists the parameters. The abstract of our work is the following:\r\n\r\nWe estimate the binding free energy between peptides and an MHC class II molecule using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM). We show that, owing to its more thorough sampling in the available computational time, the binding free energy obtained by pulling the whole peptide using a coarse-grained (CG) force field (MARTINI) is less prone to significant error induced by biased-sampling than using an atomistic force field (AMBER). We further demonstrate that using CG MD to pull 3-4 residue peptide segments while leaving the remain-ing peptide segments in the binding groove and adding up the binding free energies of all peptide segments gives robust binding free energy estimations, which are in good agreement with the experimentally measured binding affinities for the peptide sequences studied. Our approach thus provides a promising and computationally efficient way to rapidly and relia-bly estimate the binding free energy between an arbitrary peptide and an MHC class II molecule."

            "An Excel spreadsheet listing the information recorded on each of 18,686 costume designs can be viewed, downloaded, and explored.  All the usual Excel sorting possibilities are available, and in addition a useful filter has been installed.  For example, to find the number of designs that are Frieze Type #1, go to the top of the frieze type 2 column (column AS), click on the drop-down arrow and unselect every option box except True (i.e. True should be turned on, all other choices turned off). Then in the lower left corner, one reads \u201c1111 of 18686 records found\u201d.\r\n\r\nMuch more sophisticated exploration can be carried out by downloading the rich and flexible Access Database.  The terms used for this database were described in detail in three sections of Deep Blue paper associated with this project.  The database can be downloaded and explored.\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE THE ACCESS DATABASE\r\n1. Click on the Create Cohort and View Math Trait Data button, and select your cohort by clicking on the features of interest (for example: Apron and Blouse). \r\n\r\nNote:  Depending on how you exited on your previous visit to the database, there may be items to clear up before creating the cohorts.   \r\na) (Usually unnecessary)  Click on the small box near the top left corner to allow connection to Access.\r\nb) (Usually unnecessary) If an undesired window blocks part of the screen, click near the top of this window to minimize it.\r\nc) Make certain under Further Filtering that all four Exclude boxes are checked to get rid of stripes and circles, and circular buttons, and the D1 that is trivially associated with shoes.  \r\n\r\n2. Click on Filter Records to Form the Cohort button.  Note the # of designs, # of pieces, and # of costumes beside Recalculate.\r\n\r\n3. Click on Calculate Average Math Trait Frequency of Cohort button, and select the symmetry types of interest (for example: D1 and D2) .\r\n\r\n4. To view the Stage 1 table, click on Create Stage 1 table.  To edit and print this table, click on Create Excel (after table has been created).  The same process works for Stages 2, 3.and 4 tables.\r\n\r\n5. To view the matrix listing the math category impact numbers, move over to a button on the right side and click on View Matrix of Math Category Impact Numbers.  To edit and print this matrix, click on Create Excel, use the Excel table as usual.   \r\n"

The survey was conducted using Qualtrics. In the online survey, participants were shown pictures of various food items, one at a time and in a randomized order, and asked to answer several questions about each food. Participants were instructed to respond to the questions while thinking about how they typically feel when they consume the pictured food. Cluster analytic techniques in SPSS Version 24.0 were utilized to explore how food items group together based on facets of subjective experience. "

        "Description": [
            "The data set supports a study investigating which foods may be most implicated in addictive-like eating by examining how nutritionally diverse foods relate to loss of control consumption and various subjective effect reports. Participants (n = 501) self-reported how likely they were to experience a loss of control over their consumption of 30 nutritionally diverse foods and rated each food on five subjective effect report questions that assess the abuse liability of substances (liking, pleasure, craving, averseness, intensity). Hierarchical cluster analytic techniques were used to examine how foods grouped together based on each question. \r\n\r\nHighly processed foods, with added fats and/or refined carbohydrates, clustered together and were associated with greater loss of control, liking, pleasure, and craving. The clusters yielded from the subjective effect reports assessing liking, pleasure, and craving were most similar to clusters formed based on loss of control over consumption, whereas the clusters yielded from averseness and intensity did not meaningfully differentiate food items.  \r\n\r\nThe associated study applies methodology used to assess the abuse liability of substances to understand whether foods may vary in their potential to be associated with addictive-like consumption. Highly processed foods (e.g., pizza, chocolate) appear to be most related to an indicator of addictive-like eating (loss of control) and several subjective effect reports (liking, pleasure, craving). Thus, these foods may be particularly reinforcing and capable of triggering an addictive-like response in some individuals. Future research is warranted to understand whether highly processed foods are related to these indicators of abuse liability at a similar magnitude as addictive substances. \r\n\r\nThe data set is presented in both .sav format for use with SPSS software and in csv format.\r\n"

            "Note: Please see the referenced paper,  The Sharing Economy in Computing: A Systematic Literature Review. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work & social computing. ACM. by authors: Tawanna R Dillahunt, Xinyi Wang, Earnest Wheeler, Hao Fei Cheng, Brent Hecht, and Haiyi Zhu. 2018. This paper contains the full bibliography of the works cited in the description of the method below as well as a more complete description of the method in Appendix A.\r\n\r\nWe conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of sharing economy research in the ACM Digital Library (DL). \r\n\r\nIdentifying Search Terms / Corpus Collection\r\n\r\nThe first step of any SLR is to identify relevant work and to achieve this, we identified our search terms. The sharing economy has been referred to by many terms. We sought to build a comprehensive set of keywords to include terms for the sharing economy that may have been used in older literature. To accomplish this, we conducted an iterative search of repeated, relevant keywords in our corpus. First, we identified search terms based on common terms that have been used in HCI and in well-known and cited monographs of the sharing economy literature [Botsman and Rogers 2010; Sundararajan 2016]. The initial search terms were: \u201csharing economy,\u201d \u201ccollaborative consumption,\u201d \u201cpeer-to-peer exchange,\u201d \u201cphysical crowdsourcing,\u201d and \u201cgig economy.\u201d\r\n\r\nNext, we extracted the author-defined keywords from the corpus resulting from our first search of the digital ACM library. We compiled a list of all keywords that appeared in two or more papers, and then filtered those keywords that were overly vague (e.g., multi-agent systems, transportation) or conceptually unrelated to the sharing economy (e.g., dynamic pricing, experimentation). We considered the remaining repeated keywords to be synonymous or closely related to the sharing economy, and performed a search with that list. We performed this process three times, until the search yielded no new papers, for a total of four searches. Ultimately, we identified the following 21 keywords, which served as seeds for our final ACM search: \u201csharing economy,\u201d \u201ccollaborative consumption,\u201d \u201cpeer-to-peer exchange,\u201d \u201cphysical\r\ncrowdsourcing,\u201d \u201cgig economy,\u201d \u201calgorithmic management,\u201d \u201ccollaborative economy,\u201d \u201clocal online exchange,\u201d \u201cmobile crowdsourcing,\u201d \u201cnetwork hospitality,\u201d \u201con-the-go crowdsourcing,\u201d \u201cplatform economy,\u201d \u201cridesharing,\u201d \u201csocial exchange,\u201d \u201csurge pricing,\u201d \u201ctimebanking,\u201d \u201cmicro tasking,\u201d \u201cmicrotasking,\u201d \u201csituated crowdsourcing,\u201d \u201cworkplace studies,\u201d and \u201cspatial crowdsourcing.\u201d This search procedure yielded 354 papers. Next, we filtered articles using specific selection criteria to assure their\r\nappropriateness, or fit to the SLR, as described next.\r\n\r\nSelection Criteria\r\n\r\nOur first selection criterion was that articles had to be written in English owing to the constraints of the research team and the general tendency for high-quality research in computing to be published in English (for better or worse). Second, we filtered articles to exclude research that was not substantively connected to the sharing economy (despite its use of one of the keywords) or research that fell below a quality threshold. To implement this second stage, we utilized a version of the approach by Busalim and Che Hussin [Busalim and Hussin 2016]. Specifically, researchers read each paper and ranked each article as high, medium or low on the following four criteria: (1) the paper\u2019s topic was related to the sharing economy, (2) the paper had a clear research methodology, (3) the paper described the data collection process, and (4) the\r\npaper had key findings that aligned with the posed research questions. Those criteria that ranked as high received a score (loading factor) of 2, medium 1, and low 0 [Nidhra et al. 2013]. Research papers that received a 0 for the first criterion (papers unrelated to the sharing economy) were immediately excluded. Any paper that received a 1 or a 2 on the first criterion and had a total score of 5 passed through the filter; if the total score was 4 or below, the paper was excluded. It is important to point that out we did not exclude short papers, extended workshop papers, panels, or alt.chi paper purely due to their format; they were processed like full papers. After the second stage of the filtering process, we were left with a corpus containing 119 sharing economy articles. Finally, seven papers were marked as \u201cAccidentally made it through filters.\u201d These papers were irrelevant to the sharing economy and included magazine articles that we identified as think pieces (see Appendix\r\nA.2.2 Selection Criteria of the cited paper for details). This left us with a final corpus of 112 papers. \r\n\r\nData Extraction\r\n\r\nWe extracted excerpts from each work to provide: (1) the stated or implied problem or research question that was being addressed, (2) the central purpose or focus of the study, (3) a brief statement about the sample population or subjects, and (4) key results that related to the proposed study. In addition, we extracted the list of authors,\r\npublication year, title, publication venue, geographic region, the research questions, and how each paper defined the sharing economy. We also extracted keywords and coded the methodology employed as quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods, design, math modeling, or literature review. In some cases, two methodology codes were applied. For example, a paper that presented the design and field deployment of a new sharing economy application, and reported results from a qualitative user study, it would be coded as both \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201cqualitative.\u201d\r\n\r\nData Analysis\r\n\r\nTo identify topical themes in the literature, three members of our research team coded each paper in the final corpus. This was beneficial for addressing both research questions. We used the selection criteria to extract and summarize article contents as attribute codes [Onwuegbuzie 2016; Salda\u00f1a 2012] into a shared spreadsheet. This allowed us to develop a synopsis for each work and to sort the literature according to publication year, methodology used, populations sampled, instances or applications of the sharing economy studied (e.g., Airbnb, Lyft), and by publication venue. More specifically, we used hybrid coding to assign topical codes to each paper [Trochim 2006]. We leveraged existing frameworks [Owyang 2016] to create a priori codes. We also coded openly in our initial coding phase and followed this with focused coding. Focused coding allowed us to categorize significant or frequent codes that emerged from our data [Salda\u00f1a 2012]."

        "Description": [
            "The sharing economy has quickly become a very prominent subject of research in the broader computing literature and the in human\u2013computer interaction (HCI) literature more specifically. When other computing research areas have experienced similarly rapid growth (e.g. human computation, eco-feedback technology), early stage literature reviews have proved useful and influential by identifying trends and gaps in the literature of interest and by providing key directions for short- and long-term future work. In this paper, we seek to provide the same benefits with respect to computing research on the sharing economy. Specifically, following the suggested approach of prior computing literature reviews, we conducted a systematic review of sharing economy articles published in the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library to investigate the state of sharing economy research in computing. We performed this review with two simultaneous foci: a broad focus toward the computing literature more generally and a narrow focus specifically on HCI literature. We collected a total of 112 sharing economy articles published between 2008 and 2017 and through our analysis of these papers, we make two core contributions: (1) an understanding of the computing community\u2019s contributions to our knowledge about the sharing economy,\r\nand specifically the role of the HCI community in these contributions (i.e. what has been done) and (2) a discussion of under-explored and unexplored aspects of the sharing economy that can serve as a partial research agenda moving forward (i.e. what is next to do)."

We were able to identify the gender for 653 of the 705 first authors (note that several authors published multiple first-author papers in JGR in 2012 so each record is not necessarily a unique individual).

            "For data on how natural resource managers have adopted the ecosystem services (ES) paradigm, we used a web-based survey to collect responses from a stratified random sample of 1,041  resource managers in the Great Lakes basin. We designed the survey using Qualtrics Research Suite (qualtrics.com, 2015) and distributed it via email. Respondents were informed that the survey was voluntary and that all data would be kept anonymous by aggregating and de-identifying the information. We designed survey questions to gather information on the relevance of ES to managers' work as well as their backgrounds, jurisdictions, and priorities. Most questions were closed-ended, while a few were open-ended, allowing the managers to respond more freely. We received 245/1041 responses from managers, a response rate of 23.5%. We interpret this to be a conservative representation of our target audience because our sampling methods likely led to some percentage of non-resource managers receiving an invitation to participate. Of these 245 respondents, 46.1% agreed to do the survey, self-identified themselves as a resource manager in the Great Lakes basin, and completed the survey, leaving a final sample size of 113 for analysis.\r\n\r\nFor research ecologists, I used two methods for collecting data about my study subjects: interviews (not included here) and surveys. As with the managers, the online surveys were designed in Qualtrics Research Suite (qualtrics.com) and distributed via email to the scientists following the interview. Survey responses were kept anonymous resulting in our not being able to connect individual responses between the interview and survey. The survey had primarily closed-response questions with a few open-ended questions allowing respondents to provide clarification for their responses. We designed questions to gain information regarding the ecologists' research, how ES might relate to their research, and their perspective on integrating ES into resource management. The interviews with research ecologists and associated data are not provided here because they include too much personally identifiable information. \r\n\r\nIn one series of questions important to the analysis, we presented a list of 32 ES and asked the managers and ecologist to rate the relevance of each ES from 0 (Strongly Unrelated to their research) to 4 (Strongly Related). In this series of questions questions, we used a Qualtrics tool called a slider bar on which the respondents could select any decimal from 0 to 4 down to the hundredths place, making it a functionally continuous variable. This list of ES was adapted from the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment's list of ES (2005)."

        "Description": [
            "This dataset was compiled as an attempt to understand how natural resource managers and research ecologists in the Great Lakes region integrate the ecosystem services (ES) paradigm into their work. The following text is the adapted abstract from a thesis associated with this data.\r\n\r\nEcosystem services, or the benefits people obtain from ecosystems, have gained much momentum in natural resource management in recent decades as a relatively comprehensive approach to provide quantitative tools for improving decision-making and policy design. However, to date we know little about whether and how natural resource practitioners, from natural resource managers to research ecologists (hereafter managers and ecologist respectively), have adopted the ES paradigm into their respective work. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap by asking managers and ecologists about whether and how they have adopted the ES paradigm into their respective work. \r\n\r\nFirst, we surveyed federal, state, provincial and tribal managers in the Great Lakes region about their perception and use of ES as well as the relevance of specific services to their work. Although results indicate that fewer than 31% of the managers said they currently consider economic values of ES, 79% of managers said they would use economic information on ES if they had access to it. Additionally, managers reported that ES-related information was generally inadequate for their resource management needs. We also assessed managers by dividing them into identifiable groups (e.g. managers working in different types of government agencies or administrative levels) to evaluate differential ES integration. Overall, results suggest a desire among managers to transition from considering ES concepts in their management practices to quantifying economic metrics, indicating a need for practical and accessible valuation techniques.\r\n\r\nDue to a sample of opportunity at the USGS Great Lakes Science Center (GLSC), we also evaluated GLSC research ecologists\u2019 integration of the ES paradigm because they play an important role by contributing requisite ecological knowledge for ES models. Managers and ecologists almost unanimously agreed that it was appropriate to consider ES in resource management and also showed convergence on the high priority ES. However, ecologists appeared to overestimate the adequacy of ES-related information they provide as managers reported the information was inadequate for their needs. This divergence may reflect an underrepresentation of ecological economists in this system who can aid in translating ecological models into estimates of human well-being.\r\n\r\nAs a note, both CSV files in this dataset have two tabs: 1) the raw data, and 2) an index describing each column. The dataset for the research ecologists has had some data removed as it could be considered personally identifiable information due to the small sample size in that population. The surveys associated with both datasets have also been included in PDF format.\r\n\r\nCuration Notes: Three files were added to the data set on Dec 21, 2017. Two csv files: \"Ecosystem services and Research Ecologists - Data Index.csv\" and \"Ecosystem services and Research Managers - Data Index.csv\" and one text file: \"Ecosystem Services Adoption Readme.txt\". The file names of the original four files were altered to replace an ampersand with the word \"and\". "

            "This dataset accompanies a study that seeks to contribute to a clearer understanding of the discovery ecosystem in academic research libraries. Using historical literature as a case study, extensive citation analysis is employed to both reveal characteristics of secondary historical literature as well as to test a broad disciplinary discovery environment that includes six specific search platforms. By enhancing our understanding of where and how specific types of resources are \u2013or are not\u2014discoverable, as the case may be, this study can provide evidence to better inform the appropriate role and placement of various search platforms in a user\u2019s process.\r\n\r\nThis citation analysis drew upon all secondary literature that was cited in the American Historical Review (AHR) during a six-year period, from 2010 through 2015. The AHR is the official publication of the American Historical Association (AHA) and, as stated on its website, has served as \u201cthe journal of record for the historical profession in the United States since 1895.\u201d Additionally, the AHR represents all subfields of history in its research articles and reviews of new scholarship. For this study, the author gathered citations from research articles only, excluding reviews. For the purposes of testing the library discovery environment, the author aimed to include citations that a researcher would be likely to identify by using library research tools, as opposed to archival finding aids. Recognizing that some tools included in this study, such as JSTOR and Historical Abstracts, do not index archival sources, the author decided to focus on published and secondary materials. All citations to archival sources, government information, and other unpublished manuscript materials were excluded. Additionally, citations to newspaper and general or popular press articles published prior to 1900 were excluded. Citations to entire periodicals, as opposed to articles, were also excluded. Books from all date ranges were included. Citations to non-scholarly newspaper and magazine articles published after 1900 were included. Citations to published primary sources were also included in the population of citations, as one may reasonably expect to locate them in a research library setting. \r\n\r\nThe resulting population comprised 22,572 citations. After separating out duplicate citations, the total number was 19,937. Using a random number generator, the de-duplicated list of citations was re-ordered in order to select a random sample of 400, which affords a confidence level of 95% and a confidence interval of 5. \r\n\r\nThe first step in analysis was to characterize each citation according to format, publication date, and language. Secondly, the author searched for all citations in the sample in the 6 different search platforms listed above. \r\n\r\nThe primary question for each database included in the study was how comprehensively it represented the population of AHR citations, as represented by the random sample selected for this study. In order for a given citation to count as present in a particular database, it had to be represented in the format in which it was cited. For example, if a search for a cited book turned up only a dissertation, with the same author and very similar title, the analysis found that the citation was not present. For book chapters cited with authors and titles, it was not necessary for chapters to have their own records in order to be counted as present but it was necessary for them to be discernible among search results as chapters, such as in a table of contents listing. \r\n\r\nIn order to expedite the search process, the author searched Historical Abstracts and America: History and Life simultaneously on the EBSCO platform. For all of the platforms except Google Scholar, the author performed advanced searches, entering both title and author information for each citation. All searching took place between February and May of 2017. The results presented here reflect the content available to search in each platform at the time of investigation."

Criteria for inclusion were at least two levels of crop species diversity (e.g., 1 and 2 species, or 2 and 4 species), or at least two levels of functional group diversity (e.g., cereals and cereals + perennial crop). All crop rotations included at least one grain crop; agroforestry and pasture systems were beyond the scope of this study. Forty-nine publications, representing 27 cropping system sites, met criteria for inclusion in the study. To create crop rotation typologies based on functional diversity of crops, we first assigned each crop to a functional type: 1) grass or legume, 2) annual or perennial, and 3) harvested or non-harvested (cover crop). Using the above groups for individual crops, we created several typologies of crop rotations between which to construct pair-wise comparisons within sites. For a given pair-wise comparison, the control rotation had lower functional group richness than the treatment rotation. The database includes 167 crop rotations. As response variables, we recorded SOC on a concentration (g C kg-1 soil) and an areal (Mg C ha-1) basis and calculated an effect size using the response ratio of treatment to control (r = SOCt / SOCc). We log transformed response ratios (R = ln(r) = ln(SOCt) \u2013 ln(SOCc)) to perform the meta-analysis on normally distributed data. Full details of the methods can be found in: King, A.E. and J.

During the site-based survey in 2015, we systematically opened a series of 63 survey units on a 20 x 20 m grid across the eastern and southern portions of the archaeological site. Surface and immediate sub-surface materials were collected from within these survey units, which were 2 square meters in area and approximately 10 cm deep each. The ancient and modern ceramic, glass, lithics, faunal bone, and other materials were then studied in the laboratory. "

We used the Digital Alchemy inverse materials design approach to find optimal and near-optimal hard, convex, colloidal, polyhedral shapes for 13 target structures.  To construct the predictive model we performed Alchemical Monte Carlo (Alch-MC) simulations on the target structures. We placed a minimum of N = 100 particles in a periodic simulation box, with the exact number chosen to be a multiple of the number of particles in the unit cell of one of the 13 target structures. Particle shapes were initialized with as many as 64 vertices randomly generated to create a convex shape. Monte Carlo (MC) sweeps were performed to allow particle translations, rotations, and shape moves via vertex re-location. "

            "Greenhouse gas (GHG) additions to Earth\u2019s atmosphere initially reduce global outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), thereby warming the planet. In select environments with temperature inversions, however, increased GHG concentrations can actually increase local OLR. Negative top-of-atmosphere and effective radiative forcing (ERF) from this situation give the impression that local surface temperatures could cool in response to GHG increases. Here we consider an extreme scenario in which GHG concentrations are increased only within the warmest layers of winter near-surface inversions of the Arctic and Antarctic. We find, using a fully coupled Earth system model, that the underlying surface warms despite the GHG addition exerting negative ERF and cooling the troposphere in the vicinity of the GHG increase. This unique radiative forcing and thermal response is facilitated by the high stability of the polar winter atmosphere, which inhibits thermal mixing and amplifies the impact of surface radiative forcing on surface temperature. These findings also suggest that strategies to exploit negative ERF via injections of short-lived GHGs into inversion layers would likely be unsuccessful in cooling the planetary surface.",

The metric of this assessment is known as Bayesian Population Correlation (BPC).  The datasets for which this method is primarily intended for use are U-Pb ages of detrital zircons in sedimentary rocks or modern sedimentary systems.  The paper describing this method is in review (Feb. 2018) at Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems under the following title and authors:\r\n\r\nTye, A. R., Wolf, A. S., Niemi, N. A.

            "Detrital zircon age distributions provide robust insights into past sedimentary systems,\r\nbut these age distributions are often complex and multi-peaked, with sample sizes too\r\nsmall to confidently resolve population distributions. This limited sampling hinders\r\nexisting quantitative methods for comparing detrital zircon age distributions, which\r\nshow systematic dependence on the sizes of compared samples. The proliferation of\r\ndetrital zircon studies motivates the development of more robust quantitative methods.\r\nWe present the first attempt, to our knowledge, to infer probability model ensembles\r\n(PMEs) for samples of detrital zircon ages using a Bayesian method. Our method infers\r\nthe parent population age distribution from which a sample is drawn, using a Monte\r\nCarlo approach to aggregate a representative set of probability models that is consistent\r\nwith the constraints that the sample data provide.\r\nUsing the PMEs inferred from sample data, we develop a new estimate of correspondence\r\nbetween detrital zircon populations called Bayesian Population Correlation\r\n(BPC). Tests of BPC on synthetic and real detrital zircon age data show that it is nearly\r\nindependent from sample size bias, unlike existing correspondence metrics. Robust\r\nBPC uncertainties can be readily estimated, enhancing interpretive value.\r\nWhen comparing two partially overlapping zircon age populations where the shared\r\nproportion of each population is independently varied, BPC results conform almost perfectly\r\nto expected values derived analytically from probability theory. This conformity\r\nof experimental and analytical results permits direct inference of the shared proportions\r\nof two detrital zircon age populations from BPC. We provide MATLAB scripts to facilitate the procedures we describe."

A measure of wind exposure is fetch, the distance over which wind can travel across open water. In large lake systems, such as the Laurentian Great Lakes, estimating fetch has proved to be difficult due to their vast size and complex topobathymetry. Here we describe the development of two spatially discrete indicators of exposure to provide a more accurate indicator of influence of wind exposure in the nearshore of the Laurentian Great Lakes.  We summarized wind data from offshore buoys and leveraged existing tools to calculate effective fetch and relative exposure index (effective fetch scaled by mean wind speed) at a 30 m grid cell resolution.  We validated these models by comparing our exposure maps to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wave Information Studies models and found general agreement.  These exposure maps are available for public download for the years 2004-2014."

            "Biomass burning produces smoke aerosols that are emitted into the atmosphere. Some smoke constituents, notably black carbon (BC), are highly effective light-absorbing aerosols (LAA). Emitted LAA can be transported to high albedo regions like the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and affect local snowmelt. In the summer, the effects of LAA in Greenland are uncertain. To explore how LAA affect GrIS snowmelt and surface energy flux in the summer, we conduct idealized global climate model simulations with perturbed aerosol amounts and properties in the GrIS snow and overlying atmosphere. The in-snow and atmospheric aerosol burdens we select range from background values measured on the GrIS to unrealistically high values. This helps us explore the linearity of snowmelt response and to achieve high signal-to-noise ratios. With LAA operating only in the atmosphere, we find no significant change in snowmelt due to the competing effects of surface dimming and tropospheric warming. Regardless of atmospheric LAA presence, in-snow BC-equivalent mixing ratios greater than ~60 ng/g produce statistically significant snowmelt increases over much of the GrIS. We find that net surface energy flux changes correspond well to snowmelt changes for all cases. The dominant component of surface energy flux change is solar energy flux, but sensible and longwave energy fluxes respond to temperature changes. Atmospheric LAA dampen the magnitude of solar radiation absorbed by in-snow LAA when both varieties are simulated. In general, the significant melt and surface energy flux changes we simulate occur with LAA quantities that have never been recorded in Greenland."
